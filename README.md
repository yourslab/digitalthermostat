Digital Thermometer
=====

###Parts needed:
* Micro-controller (Arduino Uno, in my case)
* Display (LCD, in my case)
* Rotary encoder
* Two push buttons
* Temperature sensor
* MAX-232 (or any other form of serial communication)
* Tri-state gate (not really needed, but it makes development a lot easier)
* A bunch of wires and jumper cables
* Two LEDs (and two resistors to accompany them)
